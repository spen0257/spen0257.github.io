    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Ceejay Spencer, from the beautiful Island of Trinidad & Tobago.

I won't take this lightly I am focused and committed to doing my best.</p>
        
        <p>For as long as I can remember, art and design have been a part of my life. So intend to be a muilt-fasited designer. Please feel free to reach out so we can have a chat! </p>
